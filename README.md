## Goals

Make a game that:

* Works on the browser, whether it's my PC, my iPad, and my mobile phone. There should be no slowdowns whatsoever on the latter platforms.
* Less than 300KB total download, gzipped.
* Can be played as both a high-APM game, or a slow cerebral planning game. Can also play itself ie. wallpaper mode.
* Allows both keyboard and touch input.
